ANSWER 1:-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to 
inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
it enables code reuse and promotes the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

ANSWER 2:-
Single Inheritance:
Single inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a single superclass. 
In this approach, a subclass can have only one direct superclass. 
The subclass inherits all the members (methods and attributes) of the superclass and can override or extend them as needed.

Multiple Inheritance:
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from multiple superclasses. 
In this approach, a subclass can have multiple direct superclasses, and it inherits all their members.

ANSWER 3:-
Base Class:
The base class, also known as the superclass or parent class, is the class from which other classes inherit properties and behaviors. 
It serves as the foundation or starting point for inheritance. 
The base class defines a set of attributes and methods that can be inherited by other classes.

ANSWER 4:-Protected Access Modifier:
Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit members from the superclass, but the accessibility of those members is determined by the access modifiers.
 The "protected" access modifier grants access to 
the member within the defining class and its subclasses, but not to code outside the inheritance hierarchy.

Private Access Modifier:
The "private" access modifier restricts the access of a member to only within the defining class. It is the most restrictive access level and prevents 
access to the member from any subclass or code outside the class.

Public Access Modifier:
The "public" access modifier provides the least restrictive access level. A public member can be accessed from anywhere, including within the class, 
within subclasses, and from code outside the class.

Derived Class:
The derived class, also known as the subclass or child class, is a class that inherits properties and behaviors from a base class. 
The derived class extends or modifies the 
functionality of the base class by adding new attributes or methods or by overriding the inherited ones.

ANSWER 5:-The "super" keyword in inheritance refers to the superclass or base class from which a subclass inherits. It is used to
 access and invoke the superclass's members (methods and attributes) from within the subclass. The "super" keyword provides a way to refer to the 
superclass and access its functionality, allowing for code reuse and customization.
